## Business Goal
- to build a field-map-based app that can be used to record potholes around Toronto.
- To build a simple app. Using smartphone to test it and using computer to create an online version so that I can test it using the web platform alone.


## Process Flow
- 1. Design a database
- 2. Create a geodatabase and domain
- 3. Create features
- 4. Create attachments
- 5. Create attributes
- 6. Publish data
- 7. Create a field map app
