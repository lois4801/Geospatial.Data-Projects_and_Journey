# Geospatial.Data-Projects_and_Journey
Spatial and Non Spatial, Geospatial Data Analysis, Map Designing, Documenting and Reporting, Workflow and Asset Management

- Thanks to all of my private and exlusive sponsors for this opportunity to be able to join and present GIS projects. Most specially to learn more about GIS from all the PROS on the field.
- Special Shoutout to Master Rafik, Master Kamal, Master Samir-   ^_^.
- Thank you for entrusting me this 25grand dollars software. I will definitely make a good use of  it and maximize its fullest potential ehehehhehe

## Let's crushed it!!!
Laryssa, Raveen, Jamal and the whole gang......

## 5 Projects incoming--in progress- stay tuned
------------------------------------------------------
## Issues and Questions and Troubleshooting during my Project Formulation.

1. What is the scope of the project? who are my audience? who are the participants?
2. What are some appropriate and innapropriate data collection methods?
3. Can data gathered by those methods be considered valuable for analysis?
4. How is the data stored?
5. Multiple Layer Analysis?
6. Geospatial database vs Geodatabase?
7. What is the overlay method employed or should be employed?
8. How near or far are other features of the same type? 
9. What other types of features are nearby? 
10. How do nearby features affect one another?

## GIS- Geographical Information System
- Designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze,manage and present
- Components->> Software, hardware, Geospatial Data, GIS Analyst
- Computer based storage, retrieval, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of location-based data
-  GIS has many types of methods, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing geospatial data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Location Intelligence Applications:

- Telecommunications: Telecommunication companies use location intelligence to help with network planning.
- Governments: Government agencies use location intelligence to help determine when and where to place law enforcement to prevent crime.
- Healthcare: The healthcare sector uses location intelligence to forecast growth to assist with market segmentations.
- Retail and Hospitality Business: Retail and hospitality businesses use the technology to help determine site locations and to profile consumers.
- Real Estate: Real estate also uses location intelligence to help dictate site location and to determine the type of real estate.
