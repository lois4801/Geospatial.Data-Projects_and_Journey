# Geospatial.Data-Projects_and_Journey
Spatial and Non Spatial, Geospatial Data Analysis, Map Designing, Documenting and Reporting, Workflow and Asset Management

- Thanks to all of my private and exlusive sponsors for this opportunity to be able to join and present GIS projects. Most specially to learn more about GIS from all the PROS on the field. Special Shoutout to Master Rafik, Master Kamal, Master Samir-   ^_^.
- Thank you for entrusting me this 25grand dollars software. I will definitely make a good use of  it and maximize its fullest potential ehehehhehe

## Let's crushed it!!!
Laryssa, Raveen, Jamal and the whole gang......

## 5 Projects incoming--in progress- stay tuned
------------------------------------------------------
## Issues and Questions and Troubleshooting during my Project Formulation.

1. What is the scope of the project? who are my audience? who are the participants?
2. What are some appropriate and innapropriate data collection methods?
3. Can data gathered by those methods be considered valuable for analysis?
4. How is the data stored?
5. Multiple Layer Analysis?
6. Geospatial database vs Geodatabase?
7. What is the overlay method employed or should be employed?
8. How near or far are other features of the same type? 
9. What other types of features are nearby? 
10. How do nearby features affect one another?

## GIS- Geographical Information System
- Designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze,manage and present
- Components->> Software, hardware, Geospatial Data, GIS Analyst
- Computer based storage, retrieval, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of location-based data
-  GIS has many types of methods, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing geospatial data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Location Intelligence Applications:

- Telecommunications: Telecommunication companies use location intelligence to help with network planning.
- Governments: Government agencies use location intelligence to help determine when and where to place law enforcement to prevent crime.
- Healthcare: The healthcare sector uses location intelligence to forecast growth to assist with market segmentations.
- Retail and Hospitality Business: Retail and hospitality businesses use the technology to help determine site locations and to profile consumers.
- Real Estate: Real estate also uses location intelligence to help dictate site location and to determine the type of real estate.

# EXPERIENCE-->> GOALS

## 1. GEOSPATIAL DATA
- Selected appropriate data types for data collection or creation
- Identified the non-spatial information that is needed for a specifc application
- Documented data using established standards
- Evaluated data sources and select suitable data for a specific application
- Used GIS software and related technologies to perform data collection and creation
- Performed basic analysis of spatial data using GIS software, inclusing assesing positional accuracy of collected data
- Applied map design principles to interactive web maps, including colour, contrast, symbology and labelling
- Applied filtering and simple scripts to modify the appearance of data in an interactive map
- Documented and reported on all stages of the data collection/creation and analysis process

## 2. GEOSPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS
- Completed vector analysis using spatial analysis tools (such as buffer analysis, clip analysis, proximity analyses).
- Conducted raster analysis such as zonal statistics using desktop GIS software.
- Delineated watershed boundary using advanced modelling and DEM data.
- Created tools using ModelBuilder that can be applied to address repetitive tasks.
- Used TIN, contours and LiDAR data to solve problems.
- Used relational database for vector data management.
- Applied appropriate data classification methods to different types of data sets and for different purposes.
- Performed simple image classification.
-  Developed solutions using vector and raster analysis.

## 3. ADVANCED GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS
- Set up advanced models using model builder using GIS desktop software.
- Created GIS python scripts from models and ArcToolbox using built-in functionalities of GIS software.
- Used spatial interpolation methods within spatial statistics toolsets for interpolation methods and understand related terminologies such as semivariogram modelling.
- Completed a Kriging model using spatial interpolation techniques.
- Use data, based on SimplyAnaltyics, to extract demographic and socioeconomic data for decision support systems.
- Used ArcGIS Tracker using ArcGIS online solution.
- Set up ArcGIS online with data animation, web mapping, and visualization.
- Converted a GIS-related problem into a solution using the skills above and present the solution.
