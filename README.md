# Journey

## GIS- Geographical Information System
- Components->> Software, hardware, Geospatial Data, GIS Analyst
- Computer based storage, retrieval, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of location-based data
-  GIS has many types of methods, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing geospatial data.

## 1. GEOSPATIAL DATA
- Selected appropriate data types for data collection or creation
- Identified the non-spatial information that is needed for a specifc application
- Documented data using established standards
- Evaluated data sources and select suitable data for a specific application
- Used GIS software and related technologies to perform data collection and creation
- Performed basic analysis of spatial data using GIS software, inclusing assesing positional accuracy of collected data
- Applied map design principles to interactive web maps, including colour, contrast, symbolofy and labelling
- Applied filtering and simple scripts to modify the appearance of data in an interactive map
- Documented and report on all stages of the data collection/creation and analysis process
