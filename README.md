# Geospatial.Data-Projects_and_Journey
Spatial and Non Spatial, Geospatial Data Analysis, Map Designing, Documenting and Reporting, Workflow and Asset Management

## Thanks to all of my private and exlusive sponsors for this opportunity to be able to join and present my GIS projects. Most specially to learn more about GIS with all the PROS on the field. Super happy to join you guys- Laryssa, Raveen, Jamal ......  ^_^. 

## Let's crushed it!!!


## 5 Projects incoming-- it is still in the planning stage---  stay tuned

# Journey

## GIS- Geographical Information System
- Components->> Software, hardware, Geospatial Data, GIS Analyst
- Computer based storage, retrieval, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of location-based data
-  GIS has many types of methods, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing geospatial data.

## 1. GEOSPATIAL DATA
- Selected appropriate data types for data collection or creation
- Identified the non-spatial information that is needed for a specifc application
- Documented data using established standards
- Evaluated data sources and select suitable data for a specific application
- Used GIS software and related technologies to perform data collection and creation
- Performed basic analysis of spatial data using GIS software, inclusing assesing positional accuracy of collected data
- Applied map design principles to interactive web maps, including colour, contrast, symbolofy and labelling
- Applied filtering and simple scripts to modify the appearance of data in an interactive map
- Documented and report on all stages of the data collection/creation and analysis process

## Issues and Questions during the Formulation of the Projects.

1. What are some appropriate and innapropriate data collection methods?
2. Can data gathered by those methods be considered valuable for analysis?
3. how is the data stored?
4. Multiple Layer Analysis?
5. Geospatial database vs Geodatabase?
