Spatial and Non Spatial, Geospatial Data Analysis, Map Designing, Documenting and Reporting, Workflow and Asset Management

## Thanks to all of my private and exlusive sponsors for this opportunity to be able to join and present my GIS projects. Most specially to learn more about GIS from all the PROS on the field. Super happy to join you guys- Master Rafik, Master Kamal, Master Samir-   ^_^. 

## Let's crushed it!!!
Laryssa, Raveen, Jamal ......

## 5 Projects incoming-- it is still in the planning stage---  stay tuned

# Journey

## GIS- Geographical Information System
- Components->> Software, hardware, Geospatial Data, GIS Analyst
- Computer based storage, retrieval, analysis, manipulation, and visualization of location-based data
-  GIS has many types of methods, and techniques for collecting, analyzing, modeling and visualizing geospatial data.

## 1. GEOSPATIAL DATA
- Selected appropriate data types for data collection or creation
- Identified the non-spatial information that is needed for a specifc application
- Documented data using established standards
- Evaluated data sources and select suitable data for a specific application
- Used GIS software and related technologies to perform data collection and creation
- Performed basic analysis of spatial data using GIS software, inclusing assesing positional accuracy of collected data
- Applied map design principles to interactive web maps, including colour, contrast, symbolofy and labelling
- Applied filtering and simple scripts to modify the appearance of data in an interactive map
- Documented and report on all stages of the data collection/creation and analysis process

## Issues and Questions during my Project Formulation.

1. What is the scope of the project? who are my audience? who are the participants?
2. What are some appropriate and innapropriate data collection methods?
3. Can data gathered by those methods be considered valuable for analysis?
4. How is the data stored?
5. Multiple Layer Analysis?
6. Geospatial database vs Geodatabase?
7. What is the overlay method employed or should be employed?
8. How near or far are other features of the same type? 
9. What other types of features are nearby? 
10. How do nearby features affect one another?
