# Spatial Analysis and Managing GIS data.

## Automation For My Models
- In ArcGIS Pro, both ModelBuilder and geoprocessing tools are used for spatial analysis and managing GIS data.

### ModelBuilder 
- is a visual programming language for building geoprocessing workflows.
- It is used to create, edit, and manage geoprocessing models that automate those tools.
- Models are workflows that string together sequences of geoprocessing tools, feeding the output of one tool into another tool as input
- To build a geoprocessing model in ModelBuilder, you add tools and data to a model, and make connections between them to establish the order of execution.
- You can also add data to your model by dragging layers from the map Contents and datasets from Project into the model.

### Geoprocessing
- is a framework and set of tools for processing geographic and related data.
- A typical geoprocessing tool performs an operation on a dataset such as a feature class, raster, or table, and creates a resulting output dataset.
- For example, the Buffer tool takes features as input, creates buffer areas around the features to a specified distance, and writes those buffer areas to a new output dataset.
- In addition to the suite of tools, geoprocessing is also a powerful framework that supports control of the processing environment and allows you to build custom tools that can further automate your work.

In summary, both ModelBuilder and geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro are essential for automating GIS tasks, modeling, and analysis. They help in creating efficient workflows for spatial analysis and data management.

### Business Goal/ requirements
- To relatively create a map required in a faster way
- Using the model builder and geoprocessing to automate the whole process of buffing, clipping, selecting and intersecting data to produce the required map.

### Process Flow
- Analyzing the business requirements
-	Gathering the data
-	Analysis of the data
-	Cleaning and transforming the data- Attributes, colors, sections, symbology editing, etc.
-	Enforcing the process flow by sectioning techniques and resources to needed for the project
-	Start creating the models
-	Validating the model
-	Checking the output
-	Creating the map

### Real time back end map creation during the automation process
- This will be the same steps that I will be doing if I will do it manually.

Output 
- You may be wondering how did this happen. The data that you are seeing right now visually were actually the 100m buff roads. Under it where the deciduous forests data.
